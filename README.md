# 👋 Hey there, I'm Mohamed!

I'm a **software engineering student** at [EMSI](https://www.emsi.ma/) in Morocco — graduating in **Summer 2026** — and I’m all about building cool things with code and diving deep into how tech actually works.

I’m currently based in **Marrakech**, where the sunsets are 🔥 and the Wi-Fi... mostly behaves.

Also, I somehow have a degree in Physics an Automation.🤷‍♂️

## 🧠 A Bit About Me

I'm a curious and motivated dev who enjoys understanding how things work — not just using tools, but getting a feel for what’s going on behind the scenes. Whether it's figuring out why something's broken or experimenting with a new framework, I like to dig in and learn as I go.

Over the past few years, I’ve worked on a variety of projects — some on my own, others with classmates and teams during internships. I've built full-stack apps, played with APIs, wrangled some databases, and tackled bugs that definitely kept me humble.

Lately, I’ve been really interested in where AI is heading and how I can be part of building useful, human-friendly tech around it.
