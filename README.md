# Hey there, I'm Mohamed!

I‚Äôm passionate about building meaningful software and exploring how AI can be integrated into real-world solutions.  

I‚Äôm based in Marrakech, where the sunsets are breathtaking and the Wi-Fi... mostly cooperates.

Also, I somehow have a **bachelor‚Äôs degree in Physics and Automation**. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

## About Me

I‚Äôm a curious and motivated developer who loves understanding how things work and experimenting with new technologies. Over the past years, I‚Äôve built **full-stack applications, APIs, and SaaS platforms**, both solo and in teams during internships.  

I‚Äôm particularly excited about **AI and machine learning** ‚Äî not just as buzzwords, but as tools to **create practical, human-friendly solutions**. I want to contribute to projects that drive the **adoption and integration of AI** in real products.
